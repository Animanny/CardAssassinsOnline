Card Assassins is a social deception game made to play with your friends and family!

The game is actually [a card game](https://www.cardassassins.com/) but there's been no way to play this with friends during quarantine. As a solution, I built this web app to give people the opportunity to play with friends online!

Card Assassins is best played with 4+ players and when you're in the same room (but we don't approve of that right now, please take [COVID-19](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019) seriously and abide by your communities restrictions) OR on a voice/video call!



## How to play
When the game begins, you'll receive your mission. You'll be assigned another player as a target. In addition to target, you'll be given 3 words that you must use to execute a target

This is where it gets spicy ðŸ”¥, start a conversation! Be discrete but do your best to get your target to say one of your assigned words outloud.

If your target says one of your words aloud, be sure to let them know! Here are some options:

- KABLAM

- JOKES OVAH YO DED

- No you're crazy and you need to go down


Be sure to hit the execute button to kill your target. At this point, you'll receive THEIR target AND their words. Now all the words you've accumulated can be used to take out your next target
